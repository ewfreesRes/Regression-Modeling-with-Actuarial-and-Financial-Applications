`@part1`
“Who buys insurance and how much do they buy?”
- Companies have data on current customers
- How do get info on potential (new) customers?

To understand demand, consider the Survey of Consumer Finances (*SCF*)
- This is a nationally representative sample that contains extensive information on potential U.S. customers.
- We study a random sample of 500 of the 4,519 households with positive income that were interviewed in the 2004 survey.
- We now focus on n = 275 households that purchased term life insurance
