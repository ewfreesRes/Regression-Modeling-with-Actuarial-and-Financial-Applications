## Categorical variables

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 798485ecb7
```

`@part1`
- *Categorical variables* provide labels for observations to denote membership in distinct groups, or categories.
- A *binary variable* is a special case of a categorical variable.
- For categorical variables, there may or may not be an ordering of the groups.
- *Factor* is another term used for a (unordered) categorical explanatory variable.





`@script`
- *Categorical variables* provide labels for observations to denote membership in distinct groups, or categories.
    - To illustrate, a binary variable may tell us whether or not someone has health insurance.
    - A categorical variable could tell us whether someone has (i) private individual health insurance, (ii) private group insurance, (iii) public insurance or (iv) no health insurance.
- For categorical variables, there may or may not be an ordering of the groups.
    - For health insurance, it is difficult to say which is larger,'' private individual versus public health insurance (such as Medicare).
    - However, for education, we may group individuals from a dataset into ``low,'' ``intermediate'' and ``high'' years of education.

## Term life example

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 7166ffe0ef
```

`@part1`
- We studied *y = logface*, the amount that the company will pay in the event
of the death of the named insured (in logarithmic dollars), focusing on the explanatory variables *logincome*, *education*, and *numhh*.
- We now supplement this by including the categorical variable, *marstat*, that is the marital status of the survey respondent. This may be:
    - 1, for married
    - 2, for living with partner
    - 0, for other (SCF actually breaks this category into separated, divorced, widowed, never married and inapplicable, for persons age 17 or less or no further persons)

> Term4$marstat <- as.factor(Term4$marstat)
