## Unusual observations in regression

`@part1`
- We have defined regression estimates as minimizers of a least squares objective function.
- An appealing intuitive feature of linear regressions is that regression estimates can be expressed as weighted averages of outcomes.
- The weights vary by observation, some observations are more important than others. 
- "Unusual" observations are far from the majority of the data set:
   - Unusual in the vertical direction is called an *outlier*. 
   - Unusual in the horizontal directional is called a *high leverage point*.
