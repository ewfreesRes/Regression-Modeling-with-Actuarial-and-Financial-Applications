## Interpreting individual effects

```yaml

```

`@part1`
- **Substantive Effect**
    - Does a 1 unit difference in $x$ imply an economically meaningful difference in $y$?
- **Statistical Significance**
    - Standards for deciding whether or not a variable is statistically significant.
    - A "statistically significant effect" is the result of a  regression coefficient that is large relative to its standard error.
    - Statistical significance is driven by (i) precision of $s$, (ii) collinearity ($VIF$) and (iii) sample size
- **Causal Effects**
    - If we change $x$, would $y$ change?

`@part1`
- **Regression function and pricing**
    - The regression function is $\mathrm{E~}y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots +\beta _k x_k$.
    - Use expected claims as our baseline price for short-term insurance coverages.
- **Benchmarking studies**
    - In studies of CEO's salaries, who is making a lot (or a little), controlled for industry, years of experience and so
   forth?
    - In studies of medical claims, who are the high-cost patients?
- **Prediction**
    - A new patient comes in with a given set of characteristics, what can I say about his or her future medical claims?
