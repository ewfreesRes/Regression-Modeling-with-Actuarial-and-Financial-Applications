    - physician office visits,
    - hospital emergency room visits,
    - hospital outpatient visits,
    - hospital inpatient stays,

## Outcome variable

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 42dd6bc742
```

`@part1`
Our dependent variable is expenditures for **outpatient** admissions.

- **Inpatient** admissions include persons who were admitted to a hospital and stayed overnight.
- In contrast, **outpatient** events include hospital outpatient department visits, office-based provider visits and emergency room visits excluding dental services.
    - Includes hospital stays with the same date of admission and discharge
    - Payments associated with emergency room visits that immediately preceded an inpatient stay were included in the inpatient expenditures.
    - Prescribed medicines that can be linked to hospital admissions were included in inpatient expenditures, not in outpatient utilization.
