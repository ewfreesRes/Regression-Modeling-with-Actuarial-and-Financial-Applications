## Linear transformations of Wisconsin lottery data

```yaml
type: NormalExercise

xp: 100

key: a485262f71
```

The Wisconsin lottery dataset has already been read into a dataset `Wisc_lottery`.

Like insurance claims, lotteries are uncertain events and so you want to be able to work and interpret with lottery data readily. Much of the reports that you read have sales and population in thousands of units, so this exercise gives you practice in rescaling data via linear transformations.
